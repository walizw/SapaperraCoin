* TODO When a new block is added, don't replace the entire blockchain
Just validate that block with the latest one in the blockchain, if it's valid
it should be added to all the peers in the network.

* TODO Store the blockchain in a sqlite3 database
So when a peer connects to the network, it doesn't have to download the entire
blockchain over and over, instead just get the last block it has and ask for the
missing blocks.
